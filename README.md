Marianne Hoogeveen, Zuzanna Klyszejko

All you need to learn/teach basics of survival analysis. Presentation &amp; sample analysis included. Originally delivered at Grace Hopper Celebration in Houston, 09/27/2018 #GHC2018👩🏾‍💻

```Recent years have seen a proliferation of algorithms to address tough data-related questions. However, in practice a model with clear interpretation is often preferable over a complex one. In this workshop we invite you to experiment with survival analysis to understand why is it used to predict phenomena such as lifetime of patients in healthcare, failure of computer chips and customer churn.```
